/**
 * Concurrency
New methods have been added to the java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentHashMap class to support aggregate operations based on the newly added streams facility 
and lambda expressions. Also, new methods have been added to the java.util.concurrent.ForkJoinPool class to 
support a common pool
The new java.util.concurrent.locks.StampedLock class has been added to provide a capability-based lock 
with three modes for controlling read/write access (it might be considered as better alternative for infamous java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock).
New classes have been added to the java.util.concurrent.atomic package:
DoubleAccumulator
DoubleAdder
LongAccumulator
LongAdder
